# Solution

```ocaml
# let rec insert tree x = match tree with
    | Empty -> Node (x, Empty, Empty)
    | Node (y, l, r) ->
       if x = y then tree
       else if x < y then Node (y, insert l x, r)
       else Node (y, l, insert r x)
  let construct l = List.fold_left insert Empty l;;
```

# Statement

Construct a 
[binary search tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) 
from a list of integer numbers.

```ocaml
# construct [3; 2; 5; 7; 1];;
```

Then use this function to test the solution of the previous problem.

```ocaml
# is_symmetric (construct [5; 3; 18; 1; 4; 12; 21]);;
# not (is_symmetric (construct [3; 2; 5; 7; 4]))
```
