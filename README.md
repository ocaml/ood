Typed and Versioned Data for OCaml.org v3
-----------------------------------------

Status: Not yet open for contributions. Contact @avsm.

This repository contains data for the OCaml.org website along with a suite of
tools for managing that data. In particular:

 - `data`: stores all of the data. There are two kinds of data, those stored as yaml files and those stored in a jekyll-format (a meta-data section of yaml and a body of markdown). In addition to this the tutorials are also written using [mdx](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx) to ensure they are up to date.
 - `src`: contains the code for three separate tools.
   + `ood`: is almost exclusively OCaml modules generated by parsing and slightly modifying the `data` stored in this repository.
   + `ood-gen`: contains a suite of CLI tools for generating, parsing and fetching data. For example, `ood-gen/bin/lint.ml` reads all of the different items in `data` and ensures they are correct. This tool is run whenever you run `make test`.
   + `ood-preview`: contains a simple [dream](https://github.com/aantron/dream) server to provide a playground for experimenting with HTML rendering of the data.

For more information about the ocaml.org site, please see the main repository
at <https://github.com/ocaml/v3.ocaml.org> and the server at <https://github.com/ocaml/v3.ocaml.org-server>.

If you wish to contribute, we have some [contributing documents](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and plenty of [issues](https://github.com/ocaml/ood/issues).

**Current OCaml Version: 4.10.2** -- in order for the mdx tests to be consistent (for example some list the functions available from the `List` module) you should only run them with the current version of OCaml this repository is using.
